# ElementsCardGame
A card game made in HTML5

Before running, be sure to make the necessary changes to the `ip` variable located on line 1 of `sources/scripts/client.js`.

## How it works
As of the moment, you can run `app.js` with `node` and connect via `localhost:4000` in your browser, or, open the `sources/index.html` file to get things started. The game allows you to enter as many player names as you want. Once you are finished, submit "done". The game will then deal 7 cards from the game to each player in alternating fashion. Look in the console from the element inspector to see the result. The deck only contains 101 cards so there may be a limit to the number of players you can add...
